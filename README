Something interesting:
***********************

The following command was used after some errors while pushing the changes for the very first time using 
this user guide: "http://www.vogella.com/articles/Git/article.html"

  $ git push --all -f -u https://github.com/oynomak/moh-appointment.git

I totally recommend this command for those who will face this:

            $ git push origin master
            # To https://github.com/user/repo.git
            #  ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
            # error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'
            # To prevent you from losing history, non-fast-forward updates were rejected
            # Merge the remote changes (e.g. 'git pull') before pushing again.  See the
            # 'Note about fast-forwards' section of 'git push --help' for details.
